# üåä RIVERATHON 1.0 - High-Precision Flood Prediction System

A self-powered, always-on flood prediction system that uses 3D riverbed mapping and real-time rainfall data to provide early warnings, even in the most remote, network-less areas.

### üö® The Real-World Problem: Why This Matters

In June 2013, Kedarnath‚Äôs sudden floods from heavy rain and glacier melt claimed over 5,000 lives. Remote areas like this lack real-time river monitoring and reliable communication, leaving communities unprepared. A self-powered, LiDAR-based alert system can give precious minutes of warning‚Äîenough to save lives and reduce damage. Our system is designed to prevent such tragedies by providing a crucial head start.

### üí° Our Solution

We've developed a system that combines **LiDAR-based 3D riverbed mapping** with **real-time rainfall data** to predict flood risks with high precision. An ESP32 microcontroller processes this data locally, and if a high-risk threshold is met, it triggers multi-channel alerts.

For remote areas with no connectivity, the system uses **LoRa and Satellite IoT** to transmit alerts and ensures data integrity by logging events on a **blockchain**. The entire unit is **solar-powered**, making it self-sufficient and reliable during disasters when power grids fail.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **High-Precision Prediction**: LiDAR scans create a detailed 3D map of the riverbed, showing exactly how much water it can hold.
- **Real-Time Risk Assessment**: Combines river capacity with live rainfall data for immediate and accurate flood risk analysis.
- **Works Anywhere**: Utilizes LoRa and Satellite communication to send alerts from remote, off-grid locations.
- **Always-On & Self-Sufficient**: Solar panels combined with battery backup ensure the system runs 24/7, even during power outages.
- **Tamper-Proof Data**: Blockchain logging ensures that all sensor readings and alerts are secure, immutable, and auditable.
- **Multi-Channel Alerts**: Instantly warns communities through hardwired local sirens and sends data to a mobile/web application for authorities.
